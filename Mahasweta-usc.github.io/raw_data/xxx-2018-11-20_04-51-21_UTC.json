It will literay start to break down the mothers tissues to get its nutrients and try to survive. Gluckman et al\u00a0extended the concept of developmental plasticity by showing that fetal programming operates across the range from undernutrition to overnutrition with a U-shaped curve. This means that the future health of the baby will be affected when Mom gets either too little of the right nutrients or too much of the wrong ones.\n__ \ud83d\uded1According to the developmental origins of health and disease hypothesis, most conditions that occur in adulthood originate in foetal life. Moreover, some epigenetic events, modified inter alia by diet, impact more than one generation.\ud83d\uded1\nSo many people speak out against #vaccines , but feeding kids package processed poison is on the same scale. There's no way that a child can build #immunity when they are not eating immune boosting foods.\n__\n#Mothers have the ability to give their kids the best health Head Start by feeding them with nurturing and nutritional, micronutrient Foods. What studies show,  all living beings in their early lives, are able to adapt to their environment. If we couldn\u2019t, we would die. There is a critical period early in life where that adaptation happens, and once that period passes, we are able to adapt. Our programming is set. For example, if the mother\u2019s nutritional status is poor during pregnancy, the fetus might develop metabolic adaptations\u00a0\n__\nRoseboom et al\u00a0found that undernutrition during pregnancy affects different organs of the body and increases the risk of disease independent of birth weight. Other researchers have theorized that maternal diet may regulate blood flow to developing organs (i.e. to the brain vs. the liver) which in turn causes changes in fetal programming that affect body composition at birth and even later in life. \n__\nNow more than ever kids are being raised on packaged #processedfoods , these foods have little to no nutritional value. Kids that are growing need foods that are going to help them grow and n"
